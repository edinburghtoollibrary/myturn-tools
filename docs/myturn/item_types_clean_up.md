## Missing categories

Sometimes there is a general lack of a sub-category for something. Often wood type
items.

For example there is:

 * `Tools > Hand Tools > Hammers & Mallets > Rubber Mallets`

But there is no category for Wooden Mallets. So either you incorrectly put them under 
"Rubber Mallets" or they are lost in the general item type for all hammers.

This also happens for wood specific bits vs. masonry bits etc.

This is also true for miscellaneous items which don't have niches. For example there are
many bit types which might not deserve their own category, but would be good to separate
out under "Other" to not get lost in the root.
