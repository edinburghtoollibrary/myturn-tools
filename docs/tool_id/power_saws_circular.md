## Circular / Track / Table Saws

### Circular Saws

Plain "Circular Saws" usually refers to the hand held mobile type:

If it runs along a track it's a "Track Saw". Sometimes called a Plunge or Rail saw.

If the saw blade sticks up out of a table, it's a "Table Saw".

Unless it's teeny tiny (and possibly absolutely filthy) in which case it might be
a "Wet Tile Saw".

## Mitre Saws

Circular saw on a plate with various features:

_Sliding compound mitre saw, with distinguishing features highlighted_

1. Mitre - If the tool can pivot when viewed from above
2. Compound - If the tool can pivot when viewed from the front
3. Sliding - Kind of obvious, if it slides back and forth

⚠️ Mitre saws are often called "chop saws" informally, but true chop saws cannot
alter the angle when viewed from above.

If you only have some of the features, say Mitre + Compound, then it's a
"Compound Mitre Saw". It seems they generally drop features in a predictable
way:

 * Sliding Compound Mitre Saw
 * Compound Mitre Saw
 * Mitre Saw

I've not seen any where it slides, but doesn't tilt say.

⚠️ We also have some hand mitre saws, so watch out for misclassification here:

# Radial Arm / Chop Saws

If it basically looks like a Mitre Saw but only goes up and down, it's probably a 
"Chop Saw".We don't really seem to have any of these, so chances are it's some 
variety of mitre saw.

Another thing we don't seem to have is "Radial Arm Chop Saws"

These guys run along an overhead arm, which is different from the tube based
sliding mitre saws.
